        <p>You see, the way you think and feel about yourself, including your beliefs and expectations about what is possible for you, determines everything that happens to you.

            When you change the quality of your thinking, you change the quality of your life, sometimes instantly. Just as positive words can make someone smile or a well-timed humorous quote can make someone laugh, our thoughts react to the world in real-time.
            
            You have complete control over only one thing in the universe — your thinking – and that’s where motivational quotes come in! “Don’t take too much advice. Most people who have a lot of advice to give — with a few exceptions — generalize whatever they did. Don’t over-analyze everything.  I myself have been guilty of over-thinking problems. Just build things and find out if they work.” </p>
